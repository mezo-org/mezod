// PreBlocker returns the pre-block handler (part of the FinalizeBlock ABCI request).
// This function:
//   - Extracts the sequence of canonical AssetsLocked events from the injected
//     pseudo-transaction. Minimum validation is performed to avoid unexpected
//     panics but no error is expected here as this handler is invoked after
//     the proposal phase which guarantees the pseudo-transaction is well-formed
//     and contain a valid sequence of canonical AssetsLocked events.
//   - Accepts the AssetsLocked events by calling the bridge keeper's AcceptAssetsLocked
//     method. This call updates the internal state of the bridge module to reflect
//     the new AssetsLocked events and mints new BTC as result.
//
// Dev note: In case of success, this function should return a non-nil pointer value
// (&sdk.ResponsePreBlock{}) as ResponsePreBlock and a nil error. The specific
// value of ResponsePreBlock is not relevant for the app-level handler but, we
// try to adhere to the Go best practices and return a non-nil pointer value
// in case of success. Conversely, in case of failure, this function should return
// a nil ResponsePreBlock and a non-nil error. BEWARE: An error returned from this
// function will be bubbled up by the app-level handler and will cause the FinalizeBlock
// ABCI request to fail. This, in turn, will lead to an unrecoverable consensus failure.
// Make sure you know what you are doing before returning an error.
