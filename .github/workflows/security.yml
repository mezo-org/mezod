# The workflow runs a security scan on a Go code and outputs the report to a
# `.sarif` file and then uploads it to GitHub, so that the results could be
# browsed in GH in the repo's 'Security' tab. The security scan is done using
# `cosmos/gosec@master` action which got forked from
# https://github.com/securego/gosec and introduced some new rules targeting the
# Cosmos-SDK.
