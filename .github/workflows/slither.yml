name: Slither Analysis
# The workflow analyzes Solidity contracts using Slither, which outputs the
# report to a `.sarif` file and then uploads it to GitHub, so that the results
# could be browsed in GH in the repo's 'Security' tab. The check is triggered by
# pull requests and pushes to the `main` branch that modify Solidity files.
