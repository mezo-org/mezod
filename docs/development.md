# Local development

## Running the client locally

### Single instance

To start a single client instance locally please use the `make localnode-bin-start`
command. The script will compile the client, perform genesis, and start a local
client instance.

### Multiple client instances using docker

There is a set of `make` targets allowing to set up multiple client instances
connected to each other locally. The formulas use Docker Compose to set up the
cluster so on macOS, Docker Desktop must be running locally.

```bash
# Build and install the `mezo-org/mezod` image locally.
$ make localnet-docker-build
# Start four client instances.
$ make localnet-docker-start
# Stop client instances started with localnet-docker-start.
$ make localnet-docker-stop
# Show logs of all four client instances together.
$ make localnet-docker-show-logstream
```

The client build can take some time even if there have been no changes, so it is
not executed as part of the `localnet-docker-start` target to save time. To
rebuild the client after code changes, please explicitly re-run the
`localnet-docker-build` target.

The configuration for the four nodes is available in the `build` directory.

When `make localnet-docker-start` is used for the first time, a configuration
for the four nodes is generated. To clear the chain state and reset the
configuration, use `make localnet-docker-clean` followed by `make localnet-docker-start`.

All client instances expose JSON-RPC HTTP and JSON-RPC WebSocket services
available from the host machine.

| Instance  | JSON-RPC HTTP | JSON-RPC WS |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| mezo-node0 | 8545          | 8546        |
| mezo-node1 | 8547          | 8548        |
| mezo-node3 | 8549          | 8550        |
| mezo-node4 | 8551          | 8552        |

### Multiple client instances using local binaries

Multiple clients can also be run using locally built binaries. This method
can be useful when there are frequent changes to the code and rebuilds are
needed. However, it requires starting each node separately.

```bash
# Build the binaries and generate configuration for the clients.
$ make localnet-bin-init
# Start a single instance of the client. Needs to be called for each of the
# the clients. At least 2/3 (so 3 out of 4) of clients are needed to produce
# blocks.
$ make localnet-bin-start
# Remove the `build` and `.localnet` directories.
$ make localnet-bin-clean
```

The network consists of four clients connected to each other. All the data
generated by the clients is stored in the `.localnet` directory.
