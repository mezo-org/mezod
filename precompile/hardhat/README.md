# Precompile Hardhat Tasks

*Node.js v20 or greater is recommended*

Before getting started make sure you have changed to the hardhat directory and have installed the required
dependencies:

```
cd precompile/hardhat
npm install
```

## Networks

Hardhat is configured with two supported networks:

* `localhost` for connecting to local dev net (localnet-docker, localnet-bin).
* `mezo_testnet` for connecting to the public testnet.

All tasks and scripts support hardhat's global options which includes the `--network` flag. `localhost` is
used by default if no network is set. If running a task or script against `mezo_testnet` ensure you include
`--network mezo_testnet` as a hardhat argument.

## Accounts

Hardhat [vars](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables) are used for configuring
accounts/keys.

```
WARNING

Configuration variables are stored in plain text on your disk. Avoid using this feature for data you wouldnâ€™t
normally save in an unencrypted file. Run npx hardhat vars path to find the storage's file location.
```

You can determine what `vars` are available by running:

```
npx hardhat vars setup
```

The vars can be set to either a) a single private key, or b) a comma separated list (no whitespace) of private keys.

```
npx hardhat vars set MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

And can be removed with:

```
npx hardhat vars delete MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

## Scripts

Some helper scripts are included for convenience. It is recommended to run these scripts using `hardhat run` as they
may not execute as expected if running directly with node.

### accounts

Lists available accounts.

```
npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/accounts.ts
```

### localhost-keys

Reads seed phrases from `build` dir used by localhost based localnets and prints a comma separated list of private
keys.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/localhost-keys.ts
```

This output can be used to easily set `MEZO_ACCOUNTS` for `localhost` use.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/localhost-keys.ts | npx hardhat vars set MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```

## Tasks

We name Hardhat [Tasks](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/create-task) with a precompile prefix. This
provides clarity on which precompile the task runs against, and keeps the output of `npx hardhat help` clean as
precompile tasks get grouped together. You can view the available tasks with:

```
npx hardhat help
```

*Note: The default Hardhat tasks are still visible (e.g `compile`), many of these will do nothing as we are only using
Hardhat for tasks/testing.*

Help information for a specific task can be obtained using

```
npx hardhat help <TASK>
```

e.g:

```
npx hardhat help validatorPool:validator
```

```
Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] validatorPool:validator --operator <STRING>

OPTIONS:

  --operator	The validator's operator address

validatorPool:validator: Returns a validator's consensus public key & description
```

Here we can see the validatorPool:validator task has an operator argument - correct usage would be:

```
npx hardhat --network mezo_testnet validatorPool:validator --operator 0xc2f7Ae302a68CF215bb3dA243dadAB3290308015
```

### Running Tasks

Tasks get run as if they are built in hardhat commands. Read tasks are executed using a basic ethers provider
(no account), e.g:

```
npx hardhat --network mezo_testnet validatorPool:validators
```

Write tasks all require at minimum a signer argument, e.g:

```
npx hardhat --network mezo_testnet validatorPool:leave --signer 0xc2f7Ae302a68CF215bb3dA243dadAB3290308015
```

## Localnet

If running against a local dev net a minor adjustment to the genesis files is currently required. Due to this you must
clean and re-initialize:

```
make localnet-bin-clean
make localnet-bin-init
```

A small edit to the genesis files of each node then needs to be made before starting the network. In each nodes
`genesis.json` (`.localnet/node*/mezod/config/genesis.json`) update `consensus_params.blocks.max_gas` to `10000000`
(10 million). Then start the nodes as you normally would:

```
make localnet-bin-start
```

You can populate hardhat with the localnet accounts/private keys with the following

```
npx hardhat run scripts/localhost-keys.ts | npx hardhat vars set MEZO_ACCOUNTS
```
